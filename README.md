# SchedulifyVisualizationWebsite
Schedulify is an interactive web application that aims to simplify the understanding of CPU scheduling algorithms through visualizations. The goal is to help students and learners better comprehend the execution logic of algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling.
Schedulify is a web-based visualization platform designed to simulate and demonstrate various CPU scheduling algorithms in an interactive and graphical manner. The project helps students understand operating system scheduling concepts by visually representing how processes are executed over time.

Schedulify provides dynamic Gantt chart visualization for scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin. Users can input process details like arrival time, burst time, and priority, and the system calculates waiting time, turnaround time, and average performance metrics automatically. The platform visually compares algorithm efficiency, making it easier to analyze performance differences.

The website is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development and dynamic visualization. Interactive charts and animations enhance user understanding of process execution flow. The project focuses on improving conceptual clarity in operating systems through real-time graphical representation and user-friendly design.
